### What is Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ?
- LSP states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base class without altering the correctness of the program.
- LSP says that subtypes must be substitutable for base type.
- Objects of a child class should be as it is substitutable in a variable of parent class.
- No change should be required in codebase to accommodate a specific child class or you can say child class should not need special treatment.
- Child class should do exactly what the parent class expects.
- Inheritance might not be the best way always for re-usability.
- Do Inheritance if and only if there is a strict IS-A relationship.
